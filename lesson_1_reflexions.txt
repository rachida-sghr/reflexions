What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

-> This way you have the ability to chose what to commit and to put logical thought into each commit. 
The cons is that if you forget to commit for example you can lose your work. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-> saving multiple files in one commit permit comes in handy when these files are related to each other. One update of file a may affect file b. Then if we see in a commit that file b doesn't work but hasnt' been changed we go check file a.
